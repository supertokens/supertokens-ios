## Development Setup  

### Prerequisites
- OS: macOS
- IDE: XCode
- NodeJS
- Java

### Project Setup
1. Please setup `supertokens-core` by following [this guide](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup). If you are not contributing to `supertokens-core`, please skip  steps 1 & 4 under "Project Setup" section.
2. Clone the forked repository in the parent directory of the previously setup `supertokens-root`.  That is, `supertokens-ios` and `supertokens-root` should exist side by side within the same parent directory.
3. `cd supertokens-ios`
4. Add git pre-commit hooks
   ```
   ./setup-pre-commit.sh
   ```

## Modifying Code  
1. Open the `supertokens-ios` project in XCode by double clicking on `./Example/SuperTokensSession.xcworkspace`.
2. You can start modifying the code.

## Testing
1. Navigate to the `supertokens-root` repository
2. Start the testing environment
   ```
   ./startTestingEnv --wait
   ```
3. In a new terminal, navigate to the `supertokens-ios` repository.
4. Start a node server required for testing
   ```
   cd ./testHelpers/server/
   npm i -d
   npm i git+https://github.com:supertokens/supertokens-node.git
   cd ../..
   ./testHelpers/startServer ../supertokens-root
   ```
5. Open a new terminal in `supertokens-ios` and run all tests
   ```
   xcodebuild test -enableCodeCoverage YES -workspace Example/SuperTokensSession.xcworkspace -scheme SuperTokensSession-Example -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=14.4,name=iPhone 12 Pro' ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO
   ```
   Alternatively, you can also run all tests via XCode. The tests are present in the `Example` project.
6. If all tests pass the output should be:
